          QuizFlow was created by <strong>Kazi Musharraf</strong> with a simple objective: to replace passive study habits, like highlighting and re-reading, with <strong>active recall</strong> and <strong>spaced repetition</strong>.

        <h2 className="font-display text-xl text-ink mt-4">Privacy by Design</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike modern tools that require uploading your notes and PDFs to a cloud database, QuizFlow processes everything on your device. The deterministic Quick Mode runs entirely inside your browser tab without any network queries. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When you enable AI Mode, text blocks are streamed securely to API models and are immediately discarded. No text content, file metadata, or generated questions are saved server-side.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-display text-xl text-ink mt-4">Open Source Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          We believe educational tools should be transparent, accessible, and free of corporate locking. QuizFlow is fully open-source under the MIT license. You can export your data anytime as a standardized JSON envelope, ensuring you are always in complete control of your academic assets.
